<h2><li>Golf</li></h2>
<p>After growing up playing just about every sport I could, at the age of 13, I found the game of Golf
    It is something that over the years I have always found myself coming back to and finding new ways to reignite the love for a game I have been playing for almost 30 years.

<h2><li>Playing Guitar</li></h2>
<p>First off, let me be clear, I am no Stevie Ray Vaughan. I picked up the guitar close to 20 years ago because I have always loved music so why not try to play music. It is mainly something I do as a hobby and have never wanted it to be anything more than that. I pick up a guitar, strum a few of my favorite songs or riffs and then I am good until the next time it strikes me to pick it up.</p>
<h2><li>Working with computers</li></h2>
<p>I have been around computers nearly all my life. I still remember playing my first games on an old Macintosh before finally getting a more modern home computer. I still remember when I was kid staying up way past my bedtime and helping my father set up the dial-up internet. There was a lot of trial and error and I remember thinking we were never going to get it to work. Hours later though we were able to get the PC connected and I remember looking up old NBA stats and photos of his favorite basketball player, Larry Bird. It was a WoW this is so cool moment that has stayed with me until this day and probably a big reason why I still enjoy working on my own computers and why I finally decided to make a career change to something that I truely love doing and being around.</p>
